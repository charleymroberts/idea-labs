# Business Case

Access to accurate, timely, fresh data is at the heart of most businesses. 

The finance department will need different information to operations, which differs again from other areas and business units.

We want to be able to support each of these disparate concerns with engineers who are close the business areas. They should be optimised for flow -- able to focus on making an impact rather than being over-burdened by operational or platform concerns.

The effect is that different business units will have their own "data concierge" (I thought I coined that term, but it turns out no. Oh well). This is akin to day traders having their own "quants" or "strats" who gather and present information important to traders.

# Engineering Department

It should also be attractive to the engineering department, who can have a mature dashboard component with flow-aligned engineers who can support their disparate business functions (see [team topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/)).

We want to provide a low barrier-to-entry for creating and deploying new widgets, and allow engineers to choose whatever frameworks they like, so long as it can render as a web component.

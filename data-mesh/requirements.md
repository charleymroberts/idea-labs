# Business Case

Access to accurate, timely, fresh data is at the heart of most businesses, and ifferent users in different departments will want to see the information important to them.
The finance department will need different information to operations, which differs again from other areas and business units.

Instead of creating a single, general "analytics" dashboard which tries to be all things to all people, we want to be able to support each of these disparate concerns with engineers who are close the business areas. 


# Engineering Department

It should also be attractive to the engineering department, who can have a mature dashboard component with flow-aligned engineers who can support their disparate business functions (see [team topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/)).

We want to provide a low barrier-to-entry for creating and deploying new widgets, and allow engineers to choose whatever frameworks they like, so long as it can render as a web component.

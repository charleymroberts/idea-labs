# About
[Kind](https://www.kindservices.co.uk/) idea labs are easiest explained as long-running hackathons with a purpose. We want to help people get into tech with our objective-based learning, as well the amazing contributions of experienced practitioners to help deliver great projects for people to use. 

If you'd like to take part, just get in touch (see [our website](https://www.kindservices.co.uk/)) or simply fire an email over to [contact@kindservices.co.uk](contact@kindservices.co.uk) to receive an invite to our daily stand-up. There is no commitment - just people having fun collaborating on great projects!

# Prerequisites

If you'd like to participate in our labs, please check out [getting started](./getting-started.md).

All participants are expected to adhere to Kind's [code of conduct](https://www.kindservices.co.uk/code-of-conduct)

# Our Labs

A bit discipline of agile working is to keep your "work in progress" or "WIP" limit small. Do one thing well, rather than two things poorly!

We run our labs one-at-a-time with a clear deliverable/finish. If the community cares to keep it going or use the code for their own projects that's great. 

 * > [data-mesh](./data-mesh/about.md) - our active lab using kubernetes, micro-services, real-time streaming analytics platform
  * [language app](./language-app/about.md) - our next lab will be a mobile app written in dart and flutter


# About the name

The name was taken from Tim Urban's [What's Our Problem](https://waitbutwhy.com/2023/02/wop-contents.html), where Tim defines an "idea lab" as the opposite of an echo chamber -- a place where people are respected, but ideas are to be challenged.
